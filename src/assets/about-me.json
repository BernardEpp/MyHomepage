  "Essay": "<p>My most successful project so far was the integration of a simple third party API in an Android App. I built it in about 2 months. And it got released after that. The users loved it and so did my bosses. Since then, I have been hooked with software development.</p><p>Originally, I am a trained physicist. I love to code, learn new things and build stuff that solves problems. I have the most experience writing C# applications but also worked with Android (Java), Python, CI/CD setups and embedded systems.</p><p> As a constant learner, I am currently most interested in microservice architectures, DevOps, Kubernetes, and web development. An agile work environment is a must for me. So is an international, open, diverse and communicative workplace. I live by the standards of ‘purpose, autonomy and mastery’. I need to be involved in a companies and product's vision. I can’t just implement and debug things I don’t feel involved with.</p><p>In my free time, I love cooking, camping outdoors, sports in general and basketball in particular and I am a big history buff.</p>"
